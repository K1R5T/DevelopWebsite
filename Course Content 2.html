<h2>Describing the content and layout for each page</h2>
<br>
<p class="changeme">
My website will contain a portfolio about me and the things I have learnt so far in the tech industry. I will design it so that each page has its own title and content, the first page will be a title page which will state that this is a portfolio about me and my skills, another page will be an introduction page about myself explaining who I am and why I like technology and where I intend to take my career, I will then go on to make other pages explaining what I have learnt so far, what I want to learn and how I will do this. I will design my site so it relates to the things I am talking about.

<h2>Describing copyright and other constraints affecting websites</h2>
<br>
<p class="changeme">
Copyright is there to protect the creator of literary work, art, music, film and sound. When someone creates a website and publishes it, they are automatically protected by copyright for the content on their website under the Copyright, Designs and Patents Act 1988[1]. For developers who create sites for others, can retain their copyright protections, especially if they maintain their own graphics libraries and staff copywriters. The website footer will have the contractor’s name if this is the case.

<h2>Describing access issues that need taking into account - describe issues that people with disabilities may face when using web pages and how we can overcome them </h2>
        <p class="changeme"> <br>
There are many things to consider when creating a website, one of the most important things is ensuring that your website is accessible by all including those with disabilities
<br>
There are a few things you can do when creating a website to make it accessible to everyone, one thing you can do is create your site so that it always keyboard friendly to use, which allows a user to access the site using nothing but the tab bar to explore any links or sub menus. Making sure all content is easily accessible especially for someone using a screen reader, because if there is dynamic content on the page that changes without the page being reloaded then the user will not get told this new information unless you incorporate a tool that will tell the users screen reader about the new content. Adding alternative text to an image allows a users screen reader to read out what the image is so a user doesn’t miss out on images.
There are many things to make your website more accessible to the disabled and by doing this it allows more visitors because it is a friendly and accessible site.
