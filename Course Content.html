        <h2>The Purpose of IT in Modern Business</h2>
    
        <p>
            Technology is a big part of life for everyone these days especially with businesses as it makes a big difference it terms of how they run and keep track of data.
            <br> <br>
            Running a business is hard work and there is always an obstacle to overcome in one aspect of the business or another, but having a lot of the business digitised makes things a whole lot easier to keep track of, such as HR being able to manage and sort employees details and wage slips or the company communication system that allows employees and management to keep in touch a lot easier than having to send paper messages to all different floors just to get a 2 word response and waiting a long time for it.
            <br> <br>
            Essentially computers make running a business a little bit easier than it used to be when everything was done manually by hand. Take inventory for example, when a business wants to know how much stock is left of a certain product they can now go on a computer and check the system for accurate figures as all stock is scanned in and out on a server that keeps tally of what’s left, compared to when it was all done by hand having to actually go around doing a stock check at the end of each day counting manually.

            <h2>skills and resources needed to complete digital projects successfully – what do you need to make projects successful? What tools? What skills?</h2>
        <p>
            
            For a project to be successful the person doing it will need tools and skills relating to their task.
        <br>
        For digital tasks a person will need tools such as:
        Slack which is used for communication purposes, it allows the people on the project to discuss any issues they are having, ask another member of the team for help resolving issues or just to keep others posted about where they are up to on the project.
        <br>
        Another tool that can be used it Trello, this is used for project organisation. A trello board allows a user to set tasks and delegate them between the team assigning each person a task. This prevents the group from working on the same task as someone else and slowing the project down, it helps people to see what’s going on and see what has been done so far, and also allows the user to input a description detailing the work they are doing related to that task so other members of the group can see their progress.
        <br><br>
        Other tools can include things like:
        Idle
        <br>
        G-Suit
        <br>
        WAMP or LAMP server 
        <br>
        Internet 
        <br>
        Visual Studio
        <br>
        And many other tools.
        <br><br>
        Skills needed can include things like knowledge of python which is a programming language used to write code for things like websites and apps. Knowledge and experience using HTML is another skill someone might need when doing a digital project as this is used to create websites.
        <br>
        Other skills can include:
        <br>
        Analytics
        <br>
        HTML 
        <br> 
        CSS 
        <br>
        C#
        <br>
        Python
        <br>
        JavaScript 
        <br>
        All these things together and more is what makes a successful digital project.

        <h2>Plan and carry out tasks using IT – e.g. making your website. How will you plan it?</h2>
        <br>
        <p>
            To make a website, first I would have to research all the different tools required to perform this task and make sure I have everything to be successful in this.
        I would also set up a trello board[1] to organise my tasks and ensure I can keep track of where I am up to on the project and make notes for my self for reference purposes or just to remind me of a piece of information or code I might need.

    <h2>Describe the risks that might impact digital projects – what causes digital projects to fail? Why?</h2>
    <p>
    Some examples of risk in a digital project:
    <br>
    You could be building a website and a few months in, Samsung releases a new software update, and the site you have in development doesn’t work properly on the new system, this can cause a big set back.
    <br>
    Three months into a website build project, a competitor releases a new site with a great new feature that could draw your customers away.
    <br>
    A key team member departs your company for another opportunity mid-way through the project.
    <br>
    Unforeseen circumstances
    <br>
    There are many more risks to a digital project than those listed above, and some things just simply can not be avoided. A project can fail for many reasons, one of those is being over ambitious with the project because expecting perfection instead of embracing the fact that the project is done can result in projects that drag on way past their initially estimated time for completion and can result in the project being failed or incomplete. Finance can also be a big issue and can cause a project to fail, if the budget for a project is not realistic then it has little chance of being successful.

    <h2>Describe how you would go about selecting and using IT systems and software – how do you select the right kind of technology for the job?</h2>
   <p>
     Selecting the right technology for a project depends on the type of project someone is trying to do. For example if someone is wanting to create an app they will have to decide if they want it to run on Android, IOS or both. They will then need to look at the functions and content the app will have and then research or use prior knowledge to determine what software they will need to have for the app and they will need to be able to test the app against the latest software versions on both platforms to make sure it runs and check if there are any errors that need to be fixed before launching the app.

    <h2>Describe and provide analysis on how your chosen technologies have helped you achieve your outcomes. – How has Trello helped you plan and how can git and GitHub help with your codes version control</h2>

    <p>
    During my time on the course we created a text based game, for this we needed a few things to help us in the process. We worked in groups of four and all helped create the game.  We used Trello to plan and organise our project, it allowed us to set tasks and delegate them between the team to ensure no two people were doing the same task, it also allowed us to see where each other was up to and allowed us to comment with helpful links or lines of code that needed to be saved for later. We set up a Slack channel to allow us to communicate with each other and offer support to one another if it was needed, it was also a good place to store larger chunks of code to come back to later when it was needed. We used Idle for writing and executing the code needed to make the game functions and other code needed for it to run, Idle was also used to run the game once the coding and design had been completed.

    <h2>Describe legal guidelines and constraints that impact digital projects – How does GDPR impact digital projects?</h2>
    <p>
    <br>
    GDPR impacts a digital project in terms of how they collect, store and distribute data. When starting a digital project the person or company will have to look at what data they will be collecting, how sensitive the data is and what they will do with that data, in terms of storing data they will need to look at where it is stored, how secure their storage is and how it will be used once collected and stored. They will then need to inform every client or customer in a disclosure explaining all these things so that the customer or client is aware of what is going to happen with their data once it is collected, they will also have to inform the client/customer how long their data will be stored, and what it is used for, as well as informing them of any potential or current data breaches to ensure the data is protected correctly under GDPR regulations.
