        <h2>Review the ongoing use of IT tools and change approach as needed – in making your own website, are you happy with the tools you used? E.g. Visual Studio Code, Trello</h2>
        <p>
            I was happy with the tools I used to make my website, Trello helped me to keep track of where I was up to in the design process and helped me when planning my next steps. Visual Studio Code was great, it was so easy to use and almost self explanatory, when doing the CSS side of my website the VS code made it easier for me in terms of colour inputs and word sizing, when choosing a colour I wrote the word color and then started to type the colour I wanted and it would show me possibilities, I was then able to choose the gradient of the colour so I could make it lighter or darker. Overall VS code is a great tool to use when making a website.

        <h2>Describe whether the IT tools selected were appropriate E.g. Visual Studio Code, Trello</h2>
        <p>
            The tools I used were very appropriate for the task of creating a website, using HTML and CSS all done in Visual Studio Code, this made it easier to do the work as everything is already in a library as such in the VS code application. Trello was appropriate to ensure I did all the things I needed to do and not repeat any steps unless needed. Overall VS code is a great and appropriate tool to use

        <h2>Assess the strengths and weaknesses of your final project – are you happy with your website? Why? Why not? You should review it on the website itself in the interests of openness. What would you change?</h2>
        <p>
            As my website is just a basic standard HTML site, it does not really have any strengths or weaknesses as such. I am happy with the work I have so far in terms of what is on my website, but I could have spent more time looking at different styles for the text content, I could have also looked at adding more images to it but at this moment in time I am happy with the final project in terms of what I wanted to achieve. In terms of what would I change, I would simply just add more images, see if I can change the font style and maybe have different coloured text for each paragraph, but right now that would be too much to add into my final project as I did not have enough time.

        <h2>Describe further improvements you can make to your project</h2>
        <p>
            If I was going to improve my site I would restyle the whole site in terms of colour, images, and content. At the moment my site is suitable for what it is needed for, in the future I will look at editing my website to make it useable as a portfolio for future employment. I would edit the written content so that it is about me and my skills and what I am looking for in terms of work

            I have looked at the outcomes given to me and so far and I have completed everything that has been asked of me in terms of the course content and projects given.

        <h2>Review the benefits and drawbacks of IT tools and systems used in terms of productivity and efficiency – could you have been more efficient when making your website? How? Could you have done it in teams?</h2>
        <p>
            The benefits to using the VS code is that it contains its own library of shortcuts making it efficient to use. I don’t think I could have done anything differently in the short space of time given to do this project, if I had more time then maybe I could have done more research and possibly used other tools but for a simple basic website with a bit of CSS styling the site is perfect for what I need it for. It could have been done in a team but that could have slowed down the whole process in terms of people not agreeing on colour, style and content but if this was a business project the company would have set out rules and boundaries and would have already stated what they want in their site which would prevent the team from having disagreements as it would be a case of putting all content together and designing the site to a professional standard as a team.

        <h2>Describe ways to improve productivity and efficiency</h2>
        <p>
            Productivity and efficiency can always be improved when working on a project. Removing distraction from the workplace is a great place to start, make sure the workplace conditions are comfortable and suitable for staff and the project they are working on. When working on a project it is always beneficial to delegate tasks amongst all employees working on the project so that one person does not end up doing everything as the project could fail based on that alone. If all the staff are happy they will produce better work than if they were unhappy. All these and more can make a more productive and efficient workplace.

        <h2>Develop solutions to improve own productivity using IT in digital projects – what would you do differently next time? Team work? Use of Slack?</h2>
        <p>
            Next time I create a website there is not much I would do differently in terms of how I made the site using the tools that I used, but in terms of content I would definitely make sure my content is appropriate to the people I want viewing/visiting my site. I would look at different styling options for my text content and would look at making my site more user friendly in terms of ensuring it is suitable for people with disabilities so that it is suitable to everyone regardless of the needs and requirements for someone to view the site. Slack was not needed for this project as I did not need to communicate with anyone else to do this task, teamwork is not needed for a single project on such a small scale if I was to create a very public site for a major company then yes slack would be useful to communicate with the team that will also be working on the project as it would be on a much larger scale with a lot more content.

        <h2>Describe how you would go about testing digital solutions</h2>
        <p>
            To test my work I would ask someone to have a look at my site and tell me how easy it was to use and what if anything can be changed to improve it to suit users who visit my site and their individual needs in terms of how easy it is to navigate around the site and was the content easy enough to read and see. I would also look at using tools to test the code on my site to ensure there are no bugs in my code and it all runs smoothly.
