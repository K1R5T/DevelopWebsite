    <h3>About Me</h3>
    <p class="makepurple">
    I have always been interested in computers, when I was little I always remember looking over my uncles shoulder watching him tapping away on his computer, I always wondered what he was doing as it looked interesting.
    <br><br>
    My passion for technology increased as I got older and discovered gaming. I am a big fan of Call of Duty and discovered mod menus when I first started playing, I wondered who made them, how they made them and how they implemented them into the game, were they developers, did they have a back door access, so many questions and no one to answer them. I ended up having a chat with my brother who pointed me in the direction of CodeNation.
    <br><br>
    I had a look on their website and downloaded a brochure and that’s when I knew I had to do a course with these guys. I received a call from one of the CodeNation staff telling me about the courses, and I ended up doing Cyber Security.
    <br><br>
    Whilst on the course I saw other students learning coding on the master course and soon realised that’s what I wanted to. I joined the coding course and have learnt some amazing things so far. I have thoroughly enjoyed learning python and can’t wait to learn more in my own time and develop my skills and knowledge further. We have also learnt HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
